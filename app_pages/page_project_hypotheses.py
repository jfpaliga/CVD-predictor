        f"* The most important features from the model were found to be 'ST_Slope', 'ChestPainType', 'MaxHR', 'Age' and 'Cholesterol'.\n"
        f"* Despite the findings in the correlation studies, MaxHR, Age and Cholesterol were found to be necessary for the ML to make a prediction.\n"
        f"* 5 of the 11 features were necessary for a successful, so our hypothesis was correct."

        f"* It found that risk of heart disease increased with age.\n"
        f"* It also found that male patients were more prone to heart disease, however the dataset was imbalanced in favour of male patients.\n"
        f"* Cholesterol appeared to have no impact on heart disease, although this may be due to the data collected having a large number of '0' values.\n"
        f"* Therefore, our hypothesis was only partially correct."
